# UART to ROS2

A basic implementation of a ROS2 node to read in data from a UART device and publish it using ROS2.

## Description

This package serves as a starting point for reading in a UART device and publishing the data using ROS2. It is not intended to be a final solution, but instead a first step that can be adapted to an implementation's needs.

## Warning: Stale 

This project has gone stale, as I'm no longer working on it or have a real need for it. However, I'm leaving it up incase it is ever useful to anyone else.
